            This was an introductory-level course presents the fundamental
            kinematic, dynamic, and computational principles underlying most
            modern robotic systems. The main topics of the course include:
            coordinate transformations, manipulator kinematics, trajectory
            planning, actuation and sensing, feedback control and haptics. The
            material was reinforced with hands-on lab exercises including
            robot-arm control and control for haptic feedback. All the
            programming was done in Matlab.

            Deriving and programming the forward kinematics of the SCARA, PUMA
            and the Phantom robot.

          <li>
            Obtained the manipulability ellipsoid for both the position and
            orientation of the PUMA robot. We also obtained the positional and
            orientation singularities

          <li>
            Programming the Phantom robot to render haptic feedback. Depending
            on the encoder values of the phantom robot which was already
            obtained for us in the starter kit, we were required to render a
            haptic feedback. We had to program two different modes
            <ul>
              <li>
                One where there is a virtual sphere which has to behave as a
                stress ball. We have to program the phantom to produce a force
                on the thimble where the user keeps his finger with the
                direction and magnitude according to the position of the finger.
                We had to produce a force in the direction radially out of the
                ball and with magnitude dependant on the depth of the finger
                within the ball.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the second mode. We had to produce the effect of moving
                through a viscous fluid. We had to calculate the velocity of the
                thimble and produce a force in the opposite direction of motion
                with magnitude dependant on the velocity of the thimble. We had
                to do a running average of the velocity in order to prevent
                vibrations.
              </li>
            </ul>

            In this project, we were grouped into teams of two, we were given
            the starter kit for the plotting of the robot for simulation. We had
            to program the simulated robot to dance according to a 30 seconds
            song of choice. For this we programmed there trajectories for the
            PUMA 260 robot, linear, linear segments with parabolic blends and
            cubic trajectories. Once we had programmed the trajectories, we had
            to hand pick the via points and the via point times in the song
            according to the change in beats of the song.

            In this project, we were teamed up into group of three. In this
            project, we were required to derive the inverse kinematics of the
            PUMA 260 robot. The PUMA 260 robot had a spherical wrist. So there
            in total 8 valid solutions for each position and orientation in the
            cartesian space. We were one of the few teams who obtained the
            inverse kinematics solution within the first deadline. Once we
            obtained the IK solution, we chose the best solution according to
            the euclidean distance of the current joint angles to the eight
            solutions obtained. We rasterized a chosen image and obtained the
            rgb values at every differential position and fed the positions to
            the inverse kinematic function.
