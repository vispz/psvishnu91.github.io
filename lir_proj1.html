            The objective of the project is to use image segmentation to detect
            an object in an image. In this project the object was a bright
            pinkish-red barrel. Once the object is detected we had to identify
            the depth at which the barrel is located using the information from
            the training images.

                src="assets\Images\project\lir_ims\proj1\im1.jpg"

              I trained a Gaussian model with full covariance for each of the
              color classes. Using the connected object information I removed
              spurious noise and detected the depth. Depth was detected using
              the closeness of the detected major or minor axis length to the
              mean of the major or the minor axis length for the barrel of
              different depths.
              <br />
              The algorithm worked very well for most of the images. The
              detection was excellent in most of the situation but it failed in
              a few cases where objects of similar colors are present right next
              to the image or whenthey had reflections. It was not possible to
              eliminate the regions of unnatural shape as it would have affected
              the response to occluded objects. The depth detection worked
              exceedingly well in most cases except a few cases where the chosen
              bounding box was wrong as the image might have contained similar
              colored objects right next to the barrel.
