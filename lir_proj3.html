          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The objective of the project is to use data from the IMU of a phone
            (3 axis gyroscope and 3 axis accelerometer) and predict the gestures
            performed. We have the 6 following gestures wave, figure 8, circle,
            pendulum, hammer and fish. We have to implement Hidden Markov Models
            (HMM) to predict the probability of each sequence of observation to
            belong to a particular gesture.

              <h4>Description of approach</h4>
              By visually inspecting the variation in the sensor values, I
              trimmed of the regions where the sensors are moving randomly
              before starting of the gestures. I vector quantized the 6
              dimensional space of accelerometer and gyroscope values into 20
              clusters using data from all the gestures. Assuming a total of 15
              hidden states, I performed training using EM or Baum-Welch
              algorithm to my Hidden Markov Model. I used the recursive forward
              backward algorithm to compute the intermediate values. In order to
              account for the numerical instabilities I used the scaling
              technique mentioned in the Lawrence R. Rabiner's paper on "A
              Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in
              Speech Recognition". For the testing, I computed the log
              probability of the sequence using the Forward Algorithm.
