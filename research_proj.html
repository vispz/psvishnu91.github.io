          I worked on incorporating Lifelong Learning in a Reinforcement
          Learning (RL) framework. The idea is an agent maybe required to learn
          several RL tasks in order to perform the overall task. Each of these
          task could be learnt by a standard RL learning algorithm but all these
          different sub agents do not transfer knowledge between them (Transfer
          Learning). A recent algorithm proposed by Paul Ruvolo and Eric Eaton,
          "Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm" presents an efficient
          methodology for transfer of knowledge between several similar tasks by
          learning a set of shared basis vectors which form a knowledge base.

          KeyMe is a New York City-based startup that is revolutionizing the
          locksmith industry. KeyMe allows users to store, share, and duplicate
          their physical keys using a digital scan that is securely stored in
          the cloud. The KeyMe kiosks allow customers to instantly make copies
          of their keys. It also allows them to securely store digital copies of
          their keys so that if they ever get locked out, they can make a spare
          key at the kiosk. There were two main projects I was working on
          <ol>
            <li>
              Automating the calibration routine for the kiosk during
              installation using computer vision and machine learning.
            </li>
            <li>Checking the post cut key for errors using computer vision.</li>
          </ol>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  I initially tried to perform background subtraction to extract
                  the key image by modelling the background using GMM and
                  performing grabcut to extract the foreground. But finally I
                  just used simple thresholding in different color spaces to
                  obtain the foreground. I used the extracted foreground image
                  to extract information about the key and used this
                  information, along with certain motion run tests on the kiosk
                  to obtain the calibration parameters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For the postcut key bit depth extraction, I used standard
                  vision techniques to find the bit tip positions. I tested the
                  heights obtained from vision against a standard code book to
                  check for errors in the cutting process.
                </li>
