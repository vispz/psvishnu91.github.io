          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The objective of the project is to use the noisy signals from an IMU
            containing a 3 axis gyroscope and a 3 axis accelerometer to obtain a
            robust estimate of the orientation of an object rotated in 3D space
            and using the orientation to stitch a panoramic image of the photos
            taken by a camera mounted on the object. We are also provided ground
            truth of the orientations from a Vicon system.

              <h4>Description of approach</h4>
              I smoothed out the raw signals from the accelerometer to reduce
              the high frequency noise and then removed the bias from all the
              input signals. I multiplied the appropriate sensitivities to the
              signals which I obtained by comparing the signals with the ground
              truth from the Vicon data. I implemented Unscented Kalman
              Filters(UKF), to obtain the orientation of the image which is in
              the form of a rotation matrix, from which one can extract the
              roll, pitch and yaw angles. Using these angles I pasted the
              images, in the appropriate position on a large canvas, initially
              without any transformation and then considering only about the
              image plane. Both the techniques work only near the center of the
              canvas. Throughout the project I referred to the equations on the
              " Quaternion-based Unscented Kalman Filter for Orientation
              Tracking" paper by Edgar Kraft, University of Bonn.
