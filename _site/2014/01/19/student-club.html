              examination organized by the Central Board of Secondary Education
              (CBSE) in India. Introduced in the year 2002, this national level
              competitive test is for admission to various under-graduate
              engineering and architecture courses in institutes accepting the
              AIEEE score, mainly 30 National Institutes of Technology (NITs)
              and 5 Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIITs).The
              examination was generally held on the last Sunday of April and
              results are announced in the last week of May or the first week of
              June. Candidates are ranked on an all-India basis and state basis.
              Thus, they have an All India Rank (AIR) and a State Rank (SR).
              Since April 2013, the examination was replaced by Joint Entrance
              Examination.</i

            an amazing participation of over 2000 students in its 4 days of

            This is a fun event usually conducted a week before Valentines day,

            color, where each color has its own significance to another student
            usually of the opposite gender. The money obtained from this event
            was saved for donating to charity.

          <a href="http://archive.nittfest.in/13/">NITTFEST</a>
          is the ruthless and unforgiving annual inter-departmental cultural
          competition of NITT. I organized several events in NITTFEST'12 during
          my junior year of college, as the entire competition is organized by
          the juniors. In my senior year, I led the department of mechanical
          engineering with over five students in NITTFESTï¿½13. We came sixth
          among the twelve departments that participated equaling the all-time
          best performance of the department and we also got the all time
          highest points at the competition. There were more than 60 events in
          the competition including variety of events in arts, music, dance,
          theatre, comedy, cooking and general stage entertainment events
          requiring creativity. It was a test of my managerial and
          organizational skills, especially motivating my peers was a daunting
          task and challenged my interpersonal and communicational abilities.
          Below is the clip of our on stage event Manoranjan, where we performed
          a shadow play. I do the narration for the play.

            robot soccer which was an infotainment event where, the audience
            could play robot soccer with small mobile robots against each
            others. I had a lot of fun organizing and learnt the art of
            negotiating and effective management.
