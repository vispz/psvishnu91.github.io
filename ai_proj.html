              Spam filtering with Naive Bayes.
              <br /><br />
              <u> Problem Statement </u><br />
              In this assignment, we were provided a standard dataset of 2000
              labeled emails with equal number of spam and ham mails. We were
              also provided a labeled validation set of 400 emails again with
              equal number of spam and ham mails. The objective of the project
              was to implement a standard Naive Bayes algorithm for spam
              classification with any improvisation in the feature extraction
              and smoothing parameters.
              <br /><br />
              <u>Algorithm and Result </u><br />
              The final model chosen is a simple unigram model which was
              tokenized by splitting by spaces without any stop word but with
              header removal, and without any case adjustment or lemmatization
              but with a manually selected smoothing (Lidstone Correction). As
              shown in the results, this simple fast model was able to achieve
              an accuracy of 99% on the dev set and an accuracy of 99.1% on
              cross validation. The in sample training error for Spam and Ham
              was 0%.
