          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The objective of the project is to use the aerial map image from
            Google maps of the Penn Campus and to learn a model for predicting
            the optimal path which will be taken by a car and a pedestrian by
            using imitation learning (a type of reinforcement learning). So in
            the project a parameterized cost map generated using an
            exponentiated sum of some weighted features. Using expert examples
            of optimal policies in the Learch Algorithm, I get the weights for
            the cost map that will produce behavior similar to that of the
            expert policy.

              <h4>Description of approach</h4>
              A large chunk of this project work was focused on feature
              engineering and choosing a good seed for the feature weights to
              feed into the Learch algorithm for imitation learning. Throughout
              this report I make references to the Learch algorithm which is
              based on the paper, "Learning to Search: Functional Gradient
              Techniques for Imitation Learning" by Ratliff et al. First the
              image was resized to one eight the original size and then I
              extracted a bunch of features for every image pixel. By looking at
              the features I did an educated guess of the weights to be used as
              a seed to the Learch algorithm which works better and faster when
              the initial cost map is close to the ideal one. Now, I got a
              better estimate of the weights using Learch, though I found in
              some cases the initial seed was a better estimate when the
              learning rate is not properly set. In every iteration in the
              Learch algorithm, I compute the cost map with the recently
              computed weights which I augment by adding a loss field function
              which increases the costs at the desired path by a fraction of the
              maximum value of the current cost map (10%). Then I used dijkstra
              search, to get an optimal path. Now I take all the points in the
              optimal path and the ones in the desired path of all the MDP's
              perturb them randomly upto 3 pixels along x and y. I run a binary
              classification between the features of the points on the perturbed
              optimal path and the desired path with a L2 regularized Linear
              Support Vector Machine using Liblinear. I update the old weights
              with the weight obtained from the classification after scaling
              with an exponentially decaying learning rate. This procedure was
              done for both the car and the pedestrian.
